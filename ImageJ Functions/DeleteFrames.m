        %   Delete a set of frames from an image stack, similarly to ImageJ(FIJI).

        %   Stack = DeleteFrames(Stack, FrameIndexToDelete)

        % Description:
        %   This function removes user dictated frames from a multi-frame image stack.
        %       The input stack is expected to be a 3D numerical array where the third 
        %       dimension represents the image frame index. The frames to be deleted 
        %       are defined by the index of the frame within the multi-frame image stack.
        %   If the user defines a frame index that is not valid (index is larger than 
        %       total frames or is less than 1) will throw an error and no frames will 
        %       be deleted.
        %   Only unique frame indices will be deleted. This prevents the user from accidentally 
        %       removing the an undesired frame during a typo.
        %
        % Input:
        %   Stack              - A numerical 3D array representing an image stack, with 
        %                        dimensions Rows x Columns x Frames. 
        %   FrameIndexToDelete - Numerical array of integers that represent frame indices to be deleted.
        %
        % Output:
        %   Stack              - The modified image stack with the specified frames removed.
